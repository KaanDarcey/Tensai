Tensai is a Spaced Repetition System (SRS) to help users learn basic vocabulary in the Japanese language.

## Who is Tensai for?
Tensai was developed for users who want to build their beginner vocabulary in the japanese language. It is recommended that you know hiragana and katakana to make use of Tensai. Tensai makes use of flashcards that display both english words as well as kana and kanji characters with furigana. Tensai aims to make it easy for users to have a regular study method that is seamless and fun.

## So what is SRS exactly?
SRS or Space Repetition System is a way to help you learn. Traditional methods of memorizing flashcards can become tedious fast. SRS aims to help you retain vocabulary in your long term memmory by spacing out the recalling of words based on your current knowledge. So how does that look in practice? Essentially, when you get words correct the amount of time before you see those same words again will be longer. This way you won't keep going over words you are already confidant in and you will continue to have more frequent exposure to words you are not as strong in recalling. Ultimately this will help you retain and recall words in the long term.

## FAQ
Q: Do I have to know kanji?

A: No, kanji is not required, though it certainly wont hurt. Kanji will be shown to help visually connect the character to the word you are learning, but the kana will always be there for pronounciation.

A: Yes, the flashcards that show japanese characters do not have romaji. It is recommended you spend some time learning the the kana alphabets first. Once you are comfortable with them the repeated exposure to them in the flashcards will help you cement and solidify their meaning.

Q: Will Tensai make me fluent in Japanese?

A: No, this is only the beginning of a long journey. That being said you will learn lots of useful words that will allow you to make basic conversation. Trust the process and keep learning!
